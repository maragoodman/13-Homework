Node Express Handlebars: Eat-A-Burger

https://eat-a-burger-13.herokuapp.com/

This is an app that will use MySQL and node Node to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate an HTML, along with Express, and a homemade ORM.

## Info

- Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

- Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

- Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
